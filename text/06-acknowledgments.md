# Acknowledgments

First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor, Prof. Jonathan Runstadler, for providing guidance and mentorship. I entered both worlds of infectious disease and computational research from scratch, and Jon provided the support and environment that enabled me to grow in both fields.

Secondly, I would like to thank my committee for their unwavering support. Profs. Mark Bathe (MIT) and Jukka-Pekka Onnela (Harvard School of Public Health) both provided me with opportunities to interact with their research groups. These opportunities were valuable to my learning during tenure as a graduate student.

Thirdly, I would like to thank my wife, Dr. Nan Li, for her unwavering support and companionship. Her intelligence is a constant source of inspiration, and her patience has been a source of comfort for me.
