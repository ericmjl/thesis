# Acknowledgments

First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor, Prof. Jonathan Runstadler, for providing guidance and mentorship. I entered both worlds of infectious disease and computational research from scratch, and Jon provided the support and environment that enabled me to grow in both fields.

Secondly, I would like to thank my committee for their support and mentorship. Profs. Mark Bathe (MIT) and Jukka-Pekka Onnela (Harvard School of Public Health) both provided me with opportunities to interact with their research groups. These opportunities were valuable to my learning during tenure as a graduate student.

Thirdly, I would like to thank my wife, Dr. Nan Li, for her unwavering support and companionship. Her intelligence is a constant source of inspiration, and her patience has been a source of comfort for me.

I would also like to acknowledge the financial support of the Department of Biological Engineering, the BioMicroCenter, and the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT. The research funds provided and access to compute resources have been instrumental in conducting my research, including research projects done outside of this thesis.

Finally, all praise be to the Lord Jesus Christ, who has graciously provided all that I needed throughout my time in graduate school. My research has helped me refine a much more nuanced view on the relationship between the divine and our physical world, while simultaneously leaving me in awe at the complexity of nature. I have also learned worship of Jesus Christ through excellence in our work. While we continue the fight against infectious disease, I look forward to that day, when "there will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away" (Revelation 21:4), and infectious diseases, whichÂ have given me a topic for work, will finally be done with and be no more.
