# Acknowledgments

First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor, Prof. Jonathan Runstadler, for providing guidance and mentorship. I entered both worlds of infectious disease and computational research from scratch, and Jon provided the support and environment that enabled me to grow in both fields.

Secondly, I would like to thank my committee for their support and mentorship. Profs. Mark Bathe (MIT) and Jukka-Pekka Onnela (Harvard School of Public Health) both provided me with opportunities to interact with their research groups. These opportunities were valuable to my learning during tenure as a graduate student.

Thirdly, I would like to thank my wife, Dr. Nan Li, for her unwavering support and companionship. Her intelligence is a constant source of inspiration, and her patience has been a source of comfort for me.

Fourthly, I would like to acknowledge colleagues with whom I have worked closely on research both described here and not described here. Dr. Nichola Hill has been a wonderful collaborator and has taught me many ecology concepts, a topic I was not deeply trained in. Dr. Islam Hussein has been a close collaborator on experimental work; alongside Mia Lieberman (DCM), I have had much fun helping them with statistical analysis problems. Drs. David Duvenaud and Matthew Johnson, now at U Toronto and Google Brain respectively, gave me a wonderful introduction to the world of deep learning when I camped myself up at their office in Harvard.

Fifthly, I would like to acknowledge the undergraduate students that I have had a privilege to work with: Andrea Nickerson, Justin Zabilansky, Kyle Yuan, Ellie Laukitis, and Vivian Zhong. You are an amazing bunch, and have gone on to do wonderful things. I wish you all the best for your careers - continue doing amazing stuff!

I would also like to acknowledge the financial support and provision of resources by the Department of Biological Engineering, the BioMicroCenter, and the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT. The research funds provided and access to compute resources have been instrumental in conducting my research, including research projects done outside of this thesis.

Finally, all praise be to the Lord Jesus Christ, who has graciously provided all that I needed throughout my time in graduate school. My research has helped me refine a much more nuanced view on the relationship between the divine and our physical world, while simultaneously leaving me in awe at the complexity of nature. I have also learned the meaning of worship through excellence in our work. While we continue the fight against infectious disease, I look forward to that day, when "there will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away" (Revelation 21:4), and infectious diseases, whichÂ have given me a topic for work, will finally be done with and be no more.
