# Applications

## Application 1: Global reticulate evolution study.

Reticulate evolutionary processes, such as horizontal gene transfer and genomic reassortment, have been proposed as a major mechanism for microbial evolution [@HernandezLopez:2013dd], aiding in the diversification into new ecological niches [@Peris:2014in]. In contrast to clonal adaptation through genetic drift over time, reticulate evolutionary processes allow an organism to acquire independently evolved genetic material that can confer new fitness-enhancing traits. Examples include the acquisition of cell surface receptor adaptations (point mutations) in viruses [@Garten:2009ip] and antibiotic resistance (single genes) [@Smillie:2011jc] and pathogenicity islands (or gene clusters) in bacteria [@Antonenka:2005jea].

Host switching, defined as a pathogen moving from one host species into another, represents a fitness barrier to microbial pathogens. The acquisition of adaptations through reticulate processes either before or after transmission from one species to another may serve to aid successful pathogen host switches by improving fitness and the likelihood of continued transmission [@Remold:2008fl]. In this sense, reticulate evolution may be viewed as an ecological strategy for switching between ecological niches (such as different host species), complementing but also standing in contrast to the clonal adaptation of a microbial pathogen by genetic drift under selection. To test this idea and its importance in host switch events, which are critical for (re)-emerging infectious disease, we provide a quantitative assessment of the relative importance of reticulate processes versus clonal adaptation in aiding the ecological niche switch of a viral pathogen.

Data yielded from influenza genome sequencing projects provide a unique opportunity for quantitatively testing this concept and are suitable for the following reasons. First, the influenza A virus (IAV) has a broad host tropism [@Webster:1992wl] and is capable of infecting organisms spanning millennia of divergence on the tree of life. With different host-specific restriction factors forming an adaptive barrier, each host species may then be viewed as a unique ecological niche for the virus [@Duggal:2012jna]. Second, IAV is capable of and frequently undergoes reassortment, which is a well-documented reticulate evolutionary process [@Li:2010fd; @Mehle:2012ei; @Lam:2011jk; @Tao:2014ik]. Reassortment has also been implicated as an adaptive evolutionary mechanism in host switching [@Ince:2013kc; @Steel:2014ef], although this is most prevalently observed for pandemic viruses of public health interest for which sequences are available [@Furuse:2010bl]. Finally, as a result of surveillance efforts during the last 2 decades, whole-genome sequences have been intensively sampled during a long time frame, with corresponding host species metadata, available in an easily accessible and structured format [@Squires:2012fx]. Because reassortant viruses are the product of two or more genetically distinct viruses coinfecting the same host, a more complex process than clonal transmission and adaptation, they are expected to occur less frequently. Hence, the global IAV dataset, which stretches over time and space with large sample numbers, provides the necessary scope to detect reassortant viruses at a scale required to quantitatively assess the relative importance of reticulate events in viral host switching.

- Research question: is reassortment favoured when crossing between viral hosts?
- Results are in PNAS paper, so I will import them over with minimal modifications.
    - Main figure
- Need to describe statistical test, as this is required for a reader to understand how the statistical inference happened.

## Application 2: Viral persistence.

- Research question: is reassortment a favoured strategy for viral gene persistence across wintering seasons?
    - Lead author: Nichola Hill (post-doc in lab).
- Results: reassortment is over-represented for persistence through winter, relative to random chance. Describe statistical test.

Caveats common to both applications: always will have sampling issues with the current sequence database.
