# Applications

## Application 1: Global reticulate evolution study.
- Research question: is reassortment favoured when crossing between viral hosts?
- Results are in PNAS paper, so I will import them over with minimal modifications.
    - Main figure
- Need to describe statistical test, as this is required for a reader to understand how the statistical inference happened.

## Application 2: Viral persistence.
- Research question: is reassortment a favoured strategy for viral gene persistence across wintering seasons?
    - Lead author: Nichola Hill (post-doc in lab).
- Results: reassortment is over-represented for persistence through winter, relative to random chance. Describe statistical test.

Caveats common to both applications: always will have sampling issues with the current sequence database.
